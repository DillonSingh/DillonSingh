- Hi! I’m Dillon
- My passions are in Software Engineering and Red Teaming
- I am currently studying Cyber Security with MalTrak however, I want to do this in addition to a Software Engineering Apprenticeship
- The languages I'm currently learning are C++ & PowerShell. I want to learn a multitude of languages though
- After completing a Software Engineering Apprenticeship, I want to become a C++ Software Engineer and then a Principle C++ Software Engineer
- To continue to develop my red teaming skills, I will practice and learn from MalTrak's offensive security trainings
